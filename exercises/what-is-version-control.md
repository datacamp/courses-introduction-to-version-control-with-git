## What is version control?

A **version control system** is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project.
Many version control systems exist;
this lesson focuses on one called Git,
which is used by many of the data science tools covered in our other lessons.
Its strengths are:

* Nothing that is committed to Git is ever lost,
  so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.

* Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's,
  so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.

* Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines,
  so it scales as your team does.

Version control isn't just for software:
books, papers, data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared
can and should be stored and shared using something like Git.
